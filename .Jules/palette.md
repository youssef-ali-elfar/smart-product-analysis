## 2025-05-15 - Accessible Workflow Descriptions
**Learning:** Mermaid diagrams in README files are not accessible to screen readers. Providing a structured text-based alternative (like a numbered list) ensures that all users can understand the documented processes.
**Action:** Always include a 'Workflow Description' or equivalent text section immediately following a Mermaid diagram to maintain accessibility standards.

## 2025-05-16 - Graceful CLI Interrupt Handling
**Learning:** CLI tools that do not handle `KeyboardInterrupt` (Ctrl+C) display messy stack traces to the user. Providing a clean exit message improves the "feel" of the tool and makes it appear more professional and stable.
**Action:** Always wrap the entry point of CLI applications in a `try...except KeyboardInterrupt` block to handle user cancellations gracefully.

## 2025-05-20 - CLI Roadmap and System Feedback
**Learning:** In data science CLI tools, users benefit from immediate confirmation of their environment (library versions) and a clear roadmap of the entire analysis pipeline. This builds trust and sets expectations before they even begin.
**Action:** Incorporate a "System Status" and a full "Roadmap" section in the tool's welcome message to orient users and confirm environment readiness.

## 2026-03-17 - Visual Scannability in CLI Roadmaps
**Learning:** Using descriptive emojis in CLI roadmaps significantly improves scannability and adds a touch of delight. Emojis serve as immediate visual cues for the purpose of each stage, making the information easier to process than plain text lists alone.
**Action:** Enhance CLI roadmap lists with contextually relevant emojis to improve UX and visual hierarchy.
